# React Native mini-projects

In this repository, you'll find some mini projects using react native. You can look at each project in its own branch, or at the main branch with all the projects folder.

All of these projects are simple, aimed at practicing mobile development and keeping these codes saved for reuse in future projects that may require some of the features created in this repository.
